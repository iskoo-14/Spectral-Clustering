# Spectral-Clustering

This repository presents the implementation of Spectral Clustering for identifying cluster structures in data. The method was applied to both provided datasets (Circle and Spiral) and a custom-generated 3D dataset. All steps were implemented in Python, including custom implementations of the Inverse Power Method and the Deflation Method for computing the smallest eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix. The results were compared to classical clustering methods and visually analyzed to evaluate clustering performance.
